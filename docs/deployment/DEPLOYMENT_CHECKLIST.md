# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Production Clerk public key
- [ ] `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Production Clerk secret key  
- [ ] `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Production webhook secret
- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` - Production MongoDB connection string
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Production OpenAI API key
- [ ] `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Production Gemini API key
- [ ] `QDRANT_URL` - Production Qdrant instance URL
- [ ] `QDRANT_API_KEY` - Production Qdrant API key

### 2. Clerk Configuration
- [ ] Production Clerk application created
- [ ] Production domain added to allowed origins
- [ ] Webhook endpoints configured:
  - [ ] `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
- [ ] Sign-up/Sign-in settings configured
- [ ] Redirect URLs set to production domains

### 3. Database Setup
- [ ] Production MongoDB cluster created
- [ ] Database collections exist:
  - [ ] `users`
  - [ ] Connection tested from production environment
- [ ] Database indexes created for performance
- [ ] Backup strategy in place

### 4. Authentication Testing
- [ ] Sign-up flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Sign-in flow works end-to-end  
- [ ] Auto-redirect after sign-up works
- [ ] Route protection active on all protected routes
- [ ] API authentication working
- [ ] User data persistence working
- [ ] Usage limits enforcing correctly

### 5. Security Checks
- [ ] All API routes properly authenticated
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Proper error handling (no stack traces exposed)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all routes
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed in build
- [ ] Database queries parameterized (no injection risks)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build & Test
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run TypeScript checks
npm run build

# Test authentication flows locally
npm run dev
```

### 2. Database Migration
```bash
# If needed, run any database migrations
# Ensure user schema is up to date
```

### 3. Deploy Application
```bash
# Deploy to your hosting platform
# (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Test critical flows
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/sign-up
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/sign-in
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Authentication Flow Tests

#### 1. New User Registration
- [ ] Visit production sign-up page
- [ ] Create new account with real email
- [ ] Verify auto-redirect to main app works
- [ ] Check user data appears in database
- [ ] Verify usage limits are set correctly

#### 2. Returning User Login
- [ ] Sign out from app
- [ ] Visit sign-in page
- [ ] Log in with existing account
- [ ] Verify redirect to main app works
- [ ] Check user data loads correctly

#### 3. Route Protection
- [ ] Try accessing `/paper` without authentication
- [ ] Should redirect to sign-in
- [ ] After sign-in, should redirect back to intended page
- [ ] Try accessing API endpoints without auth (should get 401)

#### 4. Usage Limits
- [ ] Upload document (should increment counter)
- [ ] Send chat message (should increment counter)  
- [ ] Try exceeding limits (should prevent action)
- [ ] Verify usage data persists across sessions

### Performance Testing

#### 1. Authentication Speed
- [ ] Sign-up completes within 5 seconds
- [ ] Sign-in completes within 3 seconds
- [ ] App initialization after auth within 2 seconds
- [ ] User data fetching within 1 second

#### 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Network failure during auth shows proper error
- [ ] Invalid credentials show proper error message
- [ ] API failures don't crash the app
- [ ] Rate limiting works correctly

## Monitoring & Alerts

### 1. Application Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor authentication success/failure rates
- [ ] Track user registration metrics
- [ ] Monitor API response times

### 2. Database Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor MongoDB connection health
- [ ] Set up alerts for connection failures
- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Track storage usage

### 3. Third-Party Service Monitoring  
- [ ] Monitor Clerk service status
- [ ] Track OpenAI API usage and costs
- [ ] Monitor Qdrant instance health
- [ ] Set up alerts for service failures

## Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails
1. **Immediately rollback** to previous working version
2. **Check logs** for specific error messages
3. **Verify environment variables** are correctly set
4. **Test database connectivity** from production
5. **Check third-party service status**

### If Authentication Issues
1. **Verify Clerk configuration** matches production domain
2. **Check webhook endpoints** are accessible
3. **Validate environment variables** are set correctly
4. **Test with incognito browser** to eliminate cache issues
5. **Check database user collection** for data integrity

## Security Considerations

### Production Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Set secure cookie flags
- [ ] Implement proper CORS policies
- [ ] Use environment variables for all secrets
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [ ] Log security events appropriately
- [ ] Regular security dependency updates

### Data Protection
- [ ] User passwords handled by Clerk (not stored locally)
- [ ] Personal data encrypted at rest
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] GDPR compliance measures in place
- [ ] User data deletion functionality available

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check application health endpoints
- [ ] Review authentication metrics

### Weekly  
- [ ] Review user registration trends
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Monitor database performance

### Monthly
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets if needed
- [ ] Update dependencies
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Security audit
