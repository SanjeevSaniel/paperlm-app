This is a comprehensive test document for debugging and verifying the Qdrant database connection issue resolution. 

The document contains multiple sections to test various aspects of the RAG system:

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
This section introduces the purpose of this test document, which is to verify that the vector database upload functionality works correctly after implementing the UUID-based point ID system.

SECTION 2: TECHNICAL DETAILS
The technical implementation involves using proper UUID generation for Qdrant point IDs instead of string-based identifiers. This change resolved the "Bad Request" error that was preventing document chunks from being stored in the vector database.

SECTION 3: TESTING METHODOLOGY  
Our testing approach includes uploading documents, verifying storage in Qdrant, performing similarity searches, and confirming that the AI can retrieve and use the stored context effectively.

SECTION 4: EXPECTED OUTCOMES
We expect the RAG system to now work end-to-end: document upload → chunking → embedding generation → vector storage → similarity search → context retrieval → AI response generation.

SECTION 5: VERIFICATION STEPS
1. Upload this document successfully
2. Confirm points are stored in Qdrant with UUID identifiers  
3. Perform queries that should retrieve relevant chunks
4. Verify AI responses include proper context and citations

SECTION 6: CONCLUSION
This test document serves as both a verification tool and a comprehensive example of the types of content the RAG system should be able to process effectively.
